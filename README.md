# 💼 Sales and Refund Analysis

## 🚀 Business Problem & Objective
Many businesses face increasing refund rates that directly impact profit margins and customer satisfaction.  
The goal of this project is to **analyze the relationship between sales, refunds, and discounts** to identify root causes behind refund trends and propose data-driven solutions that improve revenue retention and customer loyalty.

## ⚙️ Tools & Steps Used

### 🧠 SQL – Data Cleaning & Exploration
**Main Steps:**
1. Imported raw sales dataset into SQL Server.
2. Cleaned null or duplicate values from transaction data.
3. Verified data types and fixed incorrect entries.
4. Used aggregation queries to calculate:
   - Total transactions  
   - Total and net revenues  
   - Refund counts per customer  
   - Discount and refund impact  

**Purpose:**  
To prepare a clean, structured dataset for Excel and Power BI, and ensure accuracy in refund and sales metrics.

### 📊 Excel / Power Query – Data Transformation
**Main Steps:**
1. Connected cleaned SQL data into Excel via Power Query.  
2. Performed additional transformations:
   - Removed unnecessary columns.
   - Created calculated columns like *Net Revenue*, *Refund Rate*, *Discount Amount*.  
3. Validated all KPIs using pivot tables.

**Purpose:**  
To create a unified dataset that can be visualized in Power BI.

### 🧩 Power BI – Data Modeling & Visualization
**Main Steps:**
1. Loaded transformed data from Excel into Power BI.  
2. Built relationships between tables (if any).  
3. Created the following KPIs:
   - **Total Customers:** 25K  
   - **Total Transactions:** 70K  
   - **Refund Customers:** 6,474  
   - **Refund Rate:** 25%  
   - **Customer Value (Gross):** 170  
   - **Customer Value (Net):** 153  
   - **Discount Rate:** 8%  
   - **Average Orders per Customer:** 3  
   - **Average Quantity per Customer:** 2  
4. Designed interactive dashboards to track:
   - Total and net revenues  
   - Refund trends  
   - Discount vs Refund correlation  

**Purpose:**  
To visualize refund and sales behavior and understand their effect on overall performance.

### 🪄 PowerPoint – Final Report & Insights
**Main Steps:**
1. Summarized findings and KPIs visually.  
2. Added screenshots of dashboards and SQL queries.  
3. Highlighted insights, reasons behind refund behavior, and recommendations.

**Purpose:**  
To present analysis results in a clear, story-driven format suitable for business audiences or LinkedIn showcase.

---

## 📈 Insights & Findings
- Refund rate (25%) is relatively high — indicates possible product or service dissatisfaction.  
- Discounts (8%) slightly improved sales frequency but did not reduce refunds significantly.  
- Average orders (3 per customer) show good engagement, yet revenue could rise if refund rate decreases.  
- Net customer value remains close to gross, suggesting loyal but occasionally dissatisfied customers.

---

## 💡 Recommendations
1. Analyze **top refunded products** to find root causes (quality, delivery issues, or wrong expectations).  
2. Collect **customer feedback after refund** to identify satisfaction drivers.  
3. Optimize discount strategy — link discounts to loyal, low-refund customers.  
4. Improve **post-sale support** and **refund handling efficiency** to retain customers.  
5. Monitor refund trends monthly via Power BI to spot early signs of dissatisfaction.
